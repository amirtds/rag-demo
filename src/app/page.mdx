## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

Creating a `new course` from scratch in the Open edX? It sounds exciting, right? But it can also feel like you’re at the foot of a mountain, looking up. That first page – a blank page waiting for your ideas – is both an opportunity and a challenge. Look at it: all clean and empty, ready to be filled with sections and interactive elements that will soon hold your course’s soul.

Creating high-quality educational content is often a `time-consuming` and `complex task`. By leveraging AI, we aim to simplify this process, allowing educators to focus on what they do best—teaching and inspiring students. This solution not only `speeds up content creation` but also ensures that the final product is engaging, accurate, and tailored to meet learning objectives.

## AI, LLMs and RAG

In the heart of our content creator tool lies a blend of technologies that might sound complex but are quite straightforward. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to machines designed to mimic human intelligence. Within AI, we have **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, which are like vast, interactive libraries that understand and generate text in human-like ways. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the best of both worlds: _it fetches accurate information (retrieval)_ and _then creatively molds it into new content (generation)_. Think of it as a diligent researcher and a creative writer rolled into one. Our application uses these technologies to transform various content into structured educational experiences.
